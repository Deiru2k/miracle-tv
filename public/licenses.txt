The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @apollographql/graphql-playground-html@1.6.29

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @apollographql/graphql-playground-html

**NOTE:** This is a fork of [`graphql-playground-html`](https://npm.im/graphql-playground-html) which is meant to be used by Apollo Server and only by Apollo Server.  It is not intended to be used directly.  Those looking to use GraphQL Playground directly can refer to [the upstream repository](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground) for usage instructions.

> **SECURITY WARNING:** Via the upstream fork, this package had a severe XSS Reflection attack vulnerability until version `1.6.25` of this package. **While we have published a fix, users were only affected if they were using `@apollographql/graphql-playground-html` directly as their own custom middleware.**  The direct usage of this package was never recommended as it provided no advantage over the upstream package in that regard.  Users of Apollo Server who leverage this package automatically by the dependency declared within Apollo Sever were not affected since Apollo Server never provided dynamic facilities to customize playground options per request.  Users of Apollo Server would have had to statically embedded very explicit vulnerabilities (e.g., using malicious, unescaped code, `<script>` tags, etc.).

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/accordion@1.4.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/accordion

An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each
contain a title or content snippet representing a section of content.

The headings function as controls that enable users to reveal or hide their
associated sections of content.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/accordion

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/accordion
```

## Import Components

```jsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionButton,
  AccordionPanel,
} from "@chakra-ui/accordion"
```

## Component:

- `Accordion`: manages the global state of all opened accordion items via
  context.
- `AccordionItem`: manages the state for a single accordion item.
- `AccordionButton`: the trigger to open/close an accordion item.
- `AccordionPanel`: the main content area for the accordion item.

## Usage

By default, only one accordion can be visible at a time, and it can't be
toggled.

**Note 🚨**: Each accordion button must be wrapped in an heading tag, that is
appropriate for the information architecture of the page.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <h2>
      <AccordionButton>Section 1 title</AccordionButton>
    </h2>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    <h2>
      <AccordionButton>Section 2 title</AccordionButton>
    </h2>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

To make each accordion toggle (expand/collapse) on click, pass the `allowToggle`
prop.

```jsx
<Accordion allowToggle>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionButton>
      <chakra.div flex="1" textAlign="left">
        Section 1 title
      </chakra.div>
      <AccordionIcon />
    </AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel pb={4}>Panel 1</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionButton>
      <chakra.div flex="1" textAlign="left">
        Section 2 title
      </chakra.div>
      <AccordionIcon />
    </AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel pb={4}>Panel 2</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

To allow multiple accordions to be visible at a time, pass the `allowMultiple`
prop.

```jsx
<Accordion allowMultiple>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionButton>
      <chakra.div flex="1" textAlign="left">
        Section 1 title
      </chakra.div>
      <AccordionIcon />
    </AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel pb={4}>Panel 1</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionButton>
      <chakra.div flex="1" textAlign="left">
        Section 2 title
      </chakra.div>
      <AccordionIcon />
    </AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel pb={4}>Panel 2</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/breadcrumb@1.3.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs help users visualize their current location in relation to the rest
of the website or application by showing the hierarchy of pages.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/breadcrumb

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/breadcrumb
```

## Import components

Chakra UI exports 3 breadcrumb related components:

- `Breadcrumb`: The parent container for breadcrumbs.
- `BreadcrumbItem`: Individual breadcrumb element containing a link and a
  divider.
- `BreadcrumbLink`: The breadcrumb link.

```js
import { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, BreadcrumbLink } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Usage

Add `isCurrentPage` prop to the `BreadcrumbItem` that matches the current path.
When this prop is present, the `BreadcrumbItem` doesn't have a separator, and
the `BreadcrumbLink` has `aria-current` set to `page`.

```jsx
<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="#">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="#">Docs</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem isCurrentPage>
    <BreadcrumbLink>Help</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>
```

### Separators

Change the separator used in the breadcrumb by passing a string, like `-` or any
react element (e.g. an icon)

```jsx
<Breadcrumb separator="-">
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/about">About</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem isCurrentPage>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/contact">Contact</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>
```

### Using an icon as the separator

```jsx
<Breadcrumb
  spacing="8px"
  separator={<Icon color="gray.300" name="chevron-right" />}
>
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/about">About</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>

  <BreadcrumbItem isCurrentPage>
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/contact">Contact</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/descendant@2.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Descendant

Keep track of descendant components and their relative indices.

A descendant index solution for better accessibility support in compound
components.

> **Note 🚨:** This package is primarily intended for internal use by the Chakra
> UI library. You should not use it directly in your production projects.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/descendant

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/descendant
```

## Motivation

Descendants observer is an utility hook for keeping track of descendant elements
and their relative indices.

In short, this package allows each item in a list to know it's relative index
and the parent of the list can keep track of each child, without needing to
render in a loop and pass each component an index.

This enables component composition:

```jsx
<List>
  <Item /> // I'm index 0
  <Item /> // I'm index 1<div>
    <div>
      <Item /> // I'm arbitrarily nested, but still know that I'm index 2
    </div>
  </div>
</List>
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { createDescendantContext } from "@chakra-ui/descendant"
import * as React from "react"

const [
  DescendantsProvider,
  useDescendantsContext,
  useDescendants,
  useDescendant,
] = createDescendantContext()

const MenuContext = React.createContext({})

function Menu({ children }) {
  // 1. Call the `useDescendants` hook
  const descendants = useDescendants()

  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(1)
  const context = React.useMemo(() => ({ selected, setSelected }), [selected])

  return (
    // 2. Add the descendants context
    <DescendantsProvider value={descendants}>
      <MenuContext.Provider value={context}>
        <div role="menu" style={{ maxWidth: 320 }}>
          <button
            onClick={() => {
              const prev = descendants.prev(selected)
              prev.node.focus()
              setSelected(prev.index)
            }}
          >
            Prev
          </button>
          <button
            onClick={() => {

      style={{ color: isSelected ? "red" : "black" }}
    >
      {children} - {index}
    </div>
  )
}

const Example = () => {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false)
  const [show2, setShow2] = React.useState(false)

    if (!show === true) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        setShow2(true)
      }, 1000)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
      <Menu>
        <MenuItem>One</MenuItem>
        {show && <MenuItem>Two</MenuItem>}

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/form-control@1.5.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/form-control

Form Control component is used to manage form controls such input fields,
checkbox and radio buttons. It provides components and context that make your
form fields accessible by default.

- **FormControl** - the top level component that provides context.
- **FormLabel** - the visible form control label.
- **FormHelperText** - the form control's assistive text that guides the user.
  If added, it hides when there's an error in the field.
- **FormErrorMessage** - the form control's error feedback. If there's a help
  text visible when the control is invalid, it replaces the help text, to
  prevent content shift.
- **FormErrorIcon** - an icon that indicates the error state for colorblind
  users.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/form-control

# or

npm install @chakra-ui/form-control
```

## Import component

```jsx
import {
  FormControl,
  FormLabel,
  FormErrorMessage,
  FormHelperText,
  FormErrorIcon,
} from "@chakra-ui/form-control"
```

## Basic Usage

The `FormControl` component automatically provides the `id` for the input
component to be fully accessible.

### With Input

```jsx
<FormControl>
  // automatically gets `htmlFor`
  <FormLabel>First name:</FormLabel>
  // automatically gets `id` and `aria-*` properties
  <Input placeholder="Enter your first name..." />
  // automatically gets `id` and hides if `isInvalid` is passed to `FormControl`
  <FormHelperText>Keep your first name short</FormHelperText>
  // automatically gets `id` and shows if `isInvalid` is passed to `FormControl`
  <FormErrorMessage>First name is invalid</FormErrorMessage>
</FormControl>
```

### With Checkbox group

```jsx
<FormControl as="fieldset">
  <FormLabel as="legend">Who is better:</FormLabel>
  <CheckboxGroup>
    <Checkbox>Naruto</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Boruto</Checkbox>
  </CheckboxGroup>
  <FormErrorMessage>C'mon! You must select one</FormErrorMessage>
</FormControl>
```

## Focus, Invalid and Disabled States

- When the `Input` component receives focus, it notifies the `FormControl` and
  adds `data-focus` on the `FormLabel`. Simply pass `_focus` to the `FormLabel`
  to style this state.

- If `isInvalid` is passed to the `FormControl`, it notifies the `Input` and
  adds `data-invalid` to the `FormLabel` so you can change the styles of the
  label.

- If `isDisabled` is passed to the `FormControl`, it makes the `Input` disabled,
  and adds `data-disabled` to the `FormLabel` so you can change the styles of
  the label.

## Changing the required indicator

To change the required indicator beside the `FormLabel`, simply pass the
`requiredIndicator` prop and set it to your custom indicator components.

```jsx
<FormControl as="fieldset">
  <FormLabel as="legend" requiredIndicator={CustomIndicator}>
    Who is better:
  </FormLabel>
  <CheckboxGroup>
    <Checkbox>Naruto</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox>Boruto</Checkbox>
  </CheckboxGroup>
  <FormErrorMessage>C'mon! You must select one</FormErrorMessage>
</FormControl>
```

## Adding a Visual Icon

```jsx
<FormControl
  label="Tell us about yourself:"
  helpText="Keep it short and sweet!"
  errorText="C'mon! You must select one"
>
  <InputGroup>
    <Input paddingRight="32px" />
    <InputRightElement>
      <FormErrorIcon />
    </InputRightElement>
  </InputGroup>
</FormControl>
```

  MenuGroup,
  MenuDivider,
  MenuOptionGroup,
  MenuItemOption,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Actions</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Create a Copy</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Mark as Draft</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem as="a" href="#">
      Attend a Workshop
    </MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

### Accessing the internal state

To access the internal state of the Menu, use a function as a `children`
(commonly known as a render prop). You'll get access to the internal state
`isOpen` and method `onClose`.

```jsx
<Menu>
  {({ isOpen }) => (
    <React.Fragment>
      <MenuButton>{isOpen ? "Close" : "Open"}</MenuButton>
      <MenuList>
        <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem onClick={() => alert("Kagebunshin")}>Create a Copy</MenuItem>
      </MenuList>
    </React.Fragment>
  )}
</Menu>
```

### Letter Navigation

When focus is on the `MenuButton` or within the `MenuList` and you type a letter
key, a search begins. Focus will move to the first `MenuItem` that starts with
the letter you typed.

> Open the menu, try and type any letter, say "S" to see the focus movement.

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton
    px={4}
    py={2}
    transition="all 0.2s"
    borderRadius="md"
    borderWidth="1px"
    _hover={{ bg: "gray.100" }}
    _expanded={{ bg: "red.200" }}
    _focus={{ outline: 0, boxShadow: "outline" }}
  >
    File <ChevronDownIcon />
  </MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem>New File</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>New Window</MenuItem>
    <MenuDivider />
    <MenuItem>Open...</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Save File</MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

### Just another example.

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Your Cats</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem minH="48px">
      <Image
        size="2rem"
        borderRadius="full"
        src="https://placekitten.com/100/100"
        alt="Fluffybuns the destroyer"
        mr="12px"
      />
      <span>Fluffybuns the Destroyer</span>
    </MenuItem>
    <MenuItem minH="40px">
      <Image
        size="2rem"
        borderRadius="full"
        src="https://placekitten.com/120/120"
        alt="Simon the pensive"
        mr="12px"
      />
      <span>Simon the pensive</span>
    </MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

### MenuGroup

To group related `MenuItems`, use the `MenuGroup` component and pass it a label
for the group name.

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Profile</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuGroup title="Profile">
      <MenuItem>My Account</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Payments </MenuItem>
    </MenuGroup>
    <MenuDivider />
    <MenuGroup title="Help">
      <MenuItem>Docs</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>FAQ</MenuItem>
    </MenuGroup>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

## Menu option groups

You can compose a menu for table headers to help with sorting and filtering
options. Use the `MenuOptionGroup` and `MenuItemOption` components.

```jsx
<Menu closeOnSelect={false}>
  <MenuButton>MenuItem</MenuButton>
  <MenuList minWidth="240px">
    <MenuOptionGroup defaultValue="asc" title="Order" type="radio">
      <MenuItemOption value="asc">Ascending</MenuItemOption>
      <MenuItemOption value="desc">Descending</MenuItemOption>
    </MenuOptionGroup>
    <MenuDivider />
    <MenuOptionGroup title="Country" type="checkbox">
      <MenuItemOption value="email">Email</MenuItemOption>
      <MenuItemOption value="phone">Phone</MenuItemOption>
      <MenuItemOption value="country">Country</MenuItemOption>
    </MenuOptionGroup>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

## `closeOnSelect`

`MenuItem` and `MenuItemOption` can use the `closeOnSelect` prop to override
their parent `Menu`'s behavior.

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Open Menu</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuGroup title="Profile">
      {/* Clicking on those items will close the menu (default behavior) */}
      <MenuItem>My Account</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Payments</MenuItem>
    </MenuGroup>
    <MenuDivider />
    <MenuOptionGroup title="Country" type="checkbox">
      {/* Clicking on those items will keep the menu open */}
      <MenuItemOption value="email" closeOnSelect={false}>
        Email
      </MenuItemOption>
      <MenuItemOption value="phone" closeOnSelect={false}>
        Phone
      </MenuItemOption>
      <MenuItemOption value="country" closeOnSelect={false}>
        Country
      </MenuItemOption>
    </MenuOptionGroup>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/modal@1.10.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/modal

A modal is a window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog
window. Contents behind a modal dialog are **inert** meaning that users cannot
interact with content behind the dialog.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/modal

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/modal
```

## Import components

```jsx
import {
  Modal,
  ModalOverlay,
  ModalContent,
  ModalHeader,
  ModalFooter,
  ModalBody,
  ModalCloseButton,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Usage

When the modal opens, focus is sent into the modal and set to the first tabbable
element. If there are no tabbled element, focus is set on the `ModalContent`.

```jsx
function BasicUsage() {
  const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onOpen}>Open Modal</Button>

      <Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
        <ModalOverlay>
          <ModalContent>
            <ModalHeader>Modal Title</ModalHeader>
            <ModalCloseButton />

            <ModalBody>
              <Lorem count={2} />
            </ModalBody>

            <ModalFooter>
              <Button colorScheme="blue" mr={3} onClick={onClose}>
                Close
              </Button>
              <Button variant="ghost">Secondary Action</Button>
            </ModalFooter>
          </ModalContent>
        </ModalOverlay>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Control Focus when Modal closes

When the dialog closes, it returns focus to the element that triggered. Set
`finalFocusRef` to element that should receive focus when the modal opens.

```jsx
function ReturnFocus() {
  const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
  const finalRef = React.useRef()

  return (
    <>
      <Box ref={finalRef} tabIndex={-1} aria-label="Focus moved to this box">
        Some other content that'll receive focus on close.
      </Box>

      <Button mt={4} onClick={onOpen}>
        Open Modal
      </Button>

      <Modal finalFocusRef={finalRef} isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
        <ModalOverlay>
          <ModalContent>
            <ModalHeader>Modal Title</ModalHeader>
            <ModalCloseButton />
            <ModalBody>
              <Lorem count={2} />
            </ModalBody>

            <ModalFooter>
              <Button colorScheme="blue" mr={3} onClick={onClose}>
                Close
              </Button>
              <Button variant="ghost">Secondary Action</Button>
            </ModalFooter>
          </ModalContent>
        </ModalOverlay>
      </Modal>
    </>

# Alert Dialog

AlertDialog component is used interrupt the user with a mandatory confirmation
or action.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/alert-dialog

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/alert-dialog
```

## Import components

```jsx
import {
  AlertDialog,
  AlertDialogBody,
  AlertDialogFooter,
  AlertDialogHeader,
  AlertDialogContent,
  AlertDialogOverlay,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Basic usage

## Usage

AlertDialog requires that you provide the `leastDestructiveRef` prop.

Based on
[WAI-ARIA specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alertdialog),
focus should be placed on the least destructive element when the dialog opens,
to prevent users from accidentally confirming the destructive action.

```jsx
function AlertDialogExample() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState()
  const onClose = () => setIsOpen(false)
  const cancelRef = React.useRef()

  return (
    <>
      <Button colorScheme="red" onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>
        Delete Customer
      </Button>

      <AlertDialog
        isOpen={isOpen}
        leastDestructiveRef={cancelRef}
        onClose={onClose}
      >
        <AlertDialogOverlay>
          <AlertDialogContent>
            <AlertDialogHeader fontSize="lg" fontWeight="bold">
              Delete Customer
            </AlertDialogHeader>

            <AlertDialogBody>
              Are you sure? You can't undo this action afterwards.
            </AlertDialogBody>

            <AlertDialogFooter>
              <Button ref={cancelRef} onClick={onClose}>
                Cancel
              </Button>
              <Button colorScheme="red" onClick={onClose} ml={3}>
                Delete
              </Button>
            </AlertDialogFooter>
          </AlertDialogContent>

# Drawer

The Drawer component is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen.
It can be useful when you need users to complete a task or view some details
without leaving the current page.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/modal

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/modal
```

## Import components

```jsx
import {
  Drawer,
  DrawerOverlay,
  DrawerContent,
  DrawerHeader,
  DrawerFooter,
  DrawerBody,
  DrawerCloseButton,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Basic usage

## Usage

By default focus is placed on `DrawerCloseButton` when the drawer opens.

```jsx
function DrawerExample() {
  const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
  const btnRef = React.useRef()

  return (
    <>
      <Button ref={btnRef} colorScheme="teal" onClick={onOpen}>
        Open
      </Button>
      <Drawer
        isOpen={isOpen}
        placement="right"
        onClose={onClose}
        finalFocusRef={btnRef}
      >
        <DrawerOverlay />
        <DrawerContent>
          <DrawerCloseButton />
          <DrawerHeader>Create your account</DrawerHeader>

          <DrawerBody>
            <Input placeholder="Type here..." />
          </DrawerBody>

          <DrawerFooter>
            <Button variant="outline" mr={3} onClick={onClose}>
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button color="blue">Save</Button>
          </DrawerFooter>
        </DrawerContent>
      </Drawer>
    </>
  )
}
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/popover@1.11.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/popover

Popover is a non-modal dialog that floats around a trigger. It is used to
display contextual information to the user, and should be paired with a
clickable trigger element.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/popover

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/popover
```

## Import components

```jsx
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
  PopoverHeader,
  PopoverBody,
  PopoverFooter,
  PopoverArrow,
  PopoverCloseButton,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Basic Usage

When using this component, ensure the children passed to `PopoverTrigger` is
focusable, user can tab to it using their keyboard, and it can take a `ref`. It
is critical for accessiblity.

> **A11y:** When the Popover opens, focus is sent to the `PopoverContent`. When
> it closes, focus is returned to the trigger.

```jsx
<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger>
    <Button>Trigger</Button>
  </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent>
    <PopoverArrow />
    <PopoverCloseButton />
    <PopoverHeader>Confirmation!</PopoverHeader>
    <PopoverBody>Are you sure you want to have that milkshake?</PopoverBody>
  </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

## Rendering the Popover in a Portal

By default, the Popover doesn't render in a Portal. To make them display in a
portal, pass the `usePortal` prop.

> You might need to **Inspect Element** to see this in action. Notice the
> `PopoverContent` is rendered as a child of `<body>`

```jsx
<Popover usePortal>
  <PopoverTrigger>
    <Button>Trigger</Button>
  </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent>
    <PopoverArrow />
    <PopoverHeader>Header</PopoverHeader>
    <PopoverCloseButton />
    <PopoverBody>
      <Button colorScheme="blue">Button</Button>
    </PopoverBody>
    <PopoverFooter>This is the footer</PopoverFooter>
  </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/popper@2.4.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Popper

A React hooks wrapper for popper.js to dynamic positioning of containers around
a reference.

> This is an internal hook of Chakra-UI and it's not covered by semver, and may
> cause unexpected or broken application behavior. Use them at your own risk.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/popper
```

## Basic usage

By default, the `usePopper` hook returns props for the popper, reference and
arrow.

```jsx
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/layout'
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/button'
import { useDisclosure } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
import { usePopper } from "@chakra-ui/popper"

function Example() {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure()
  const { popperRef, referenceRef, getArrowProps } = usePopper()
  return (
    <>
      <Button ref={referenceRef} onClick={onToggle} mb={2}>
        {isOpen ? "Click me to see less" : "Click me to see more"}
      </Button>
      {isOpen && (
        <Box ref={popperRef} bg="red">
          <div
            {...getArrowProps({
              style: {
                background: "red",
              },
            })}
          />
          This is a popover for the button!
        </Box>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```

## Parameters

### Changing the placement

You can change the placement of the popper by passing the `placement` option to
`usePopper` and set it to the `popper.js` placement.

```jsx
const { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({
  placement: "right-start",
})
```

### Match reference's width

In some cases, you might want to allow the popper take the width of the
reference. For example, autocomplete, select, etc.

To achieve this, pass the `matchWidth` option and set it to `true`

```jsx
const { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({
  matchWidth: true,
})
```

### Place the popper next to the reference

You can place the popper next to the reference without margin or distance between them.
Useful to create an autocomplete or typeahead feature.

```jsx
const { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({
  gutter: 0,
})
```

### Using inside a fixed container

If the reference element is inside a fixed container, you should use the `fixed` strategy.

```jsx
const { popperRef, referenceRef } = usePopper({
  strategy: 'fixed',
})
```

## Adding transition

When add transitions to a popper component, it is usually advised to apply
popper and transition to different elements.

```jsx
// 1. Import components
import { useDisclosure } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
import { usePopper } from "@chakra-ui/popper"
import { motion, AnimatePresence, Variants } from "framer-motion"

export function Example() {
  // 2. Create toggle state
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure()

  // 3. Create motion variants
  const slide: Variants = {
    exit: {
      y: -2,
      opacity: 0,
    },
    enter: {
      y: 0,
      opacity: 1,
    },
  }

  // 4. Consume the `usePopper` hook
  const { getPopperProps, getReferenceProps, getArrowProps, transformOrigin } = usePopper({
    placement: "bottom-start",
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button {...getReferenceProps({ onClick: onToggle })}>Toggle</button>
      <div {...getPopperProps()}>
        <AnimatePresence>
          {isOpen && (
            <motion.div
              transition={{
                type: "spring",
                duration: 0.2,
              }}
              variants={slide}
              initial="exit"
              animate="enter"
              exit="exit"
              style={{
                background: "red",
                width: 200,
                transformOrigin,
                borderRadius: 4,
              }}
            >
              Testing
              <div
                {...getArrowProps({
                  style: {
                    background: "red",
                  },
                })}
              />
            </motion.div>
          )}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

> When not rendering the popper conditionally, we recommend using
> `visibility: hidden` instead of `hidden` or `display: none`

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/portal@1.3.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/portal

A wrapper for rendering components in React Portals, with support for nested
portals and stacking.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/portal

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/portal
```

## Import components

```jsx
import { Portal, PortalManager } from "@chakra-ui/portal"
```

Render the `PortalManager` once at the root of your application

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      <PortalManager>{/* Your app goes here  */}</PortalManager>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

### Basic usage

Portals are render into the portal manager's node by default not
`document.body`.

```jsx
<div>
  <p>Welcome</p>
  <Portal>This text has been portaled</Portal>
</div>
```

### Nested portals

Nesting portal can be very useful to build complex widgets like nested menu,
popovers, modal, etc.

```jsx
<Portal>
  This is a portal.
  <Portal>This is a nested portal</Portal>
</Portal>
```

### Custom container

You can also portal elements into a custom containers. Simply pass a
`containerRef` prop that points to the `node` of that element.

```jsx
<>
  <div ref={ref} />
  <Portal containerRef={ref}>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  </Portal>
</>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/progress@1.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Progress

The Progress component is an element that displays the progress status for a
task that takes a long time or consists of several steps.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/progress

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/progress
```

## Import Components

```jsx
import {
  Progress,
  ProgressLabel,
  CircularProgress,
  CircularProgressLabel,
} from "@chakra-ui/progress"
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Progress value={50} />
```

## Linear Progress

```jsx
<Progress value={50} />
```

## Color

Pass the `color` prop to apply any color that exists in the theme to the
progress

```jsx
<Progress color="pink" value={20} />
```

## Sizes

Pass the `size` prop to increase the height of the progress

```jsx
<Progress size="sm" value={20} />
<Progress size="lg" value={20} />
```

## Indeterminate

Pass the `value` for the progress as `undefined` to put the progress component
in the indeterminate state

```jsx
<Progress margin="20px" size="xs" value={undefined} />
```

## With stripe

Pass the `hasStripe` prop to have a beautiful gradient to create a striped
effect on the progress

```jsx
<Progress color="green" hasStripe value={20} />
```

## With animation

Pass the `isAnimated` prop combined with the `hasStrip` prop to get a
beautifully animated progress

```jsx
<Progress hasStripe isAnimated value={20} />
```

## With label

Use the `ProgressLabel` utility component to have a label for the progress
component

```jsx
<Progress value={60}>
  <ProgressLabel>60%</ProgressLabel>
</Progress>
```

## Circular progress

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={50} />
```

## Circular progress size

Pass the `size` prop to change the size of the circular progress. You can also
pass the `thickness` prop to change the thickness of the circular progress. The
`thickness` prop is a fractional value whose actual value is determined by the
`size` of the circular progress. In this example the circular progress will have
a thickness of 30px. 50% of size (120px) => 30px

```jsx
<CircularProgress size="120px" thickness={0.5} value={60} />
```

## Circular progress color

Pass the `color` prop to apply any color that exists in the theme

```jsx
<CircularProgress color="pink" value={20} />
```

## Circular progress with label

Use the `CircularProgressLabel` utility component to have a label for the
circular progress

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={60}>
  <CircularProgressLabel>60%</CircularProgressLabel>
</CircularProgress>
```

## Accessibility

- Progress has a role set to progressbar to denote that it is a progress bar
- Progress has aria-valuenow set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.

## Note

The CircularProgress and the Spinner may seem to serve the same purpose, but
semantically, they don't. In the `indeterminate` state they have the following
difference.

### CircularProgress

It is used to denote the progress of a determinate operation. Take for example
an image upload operation:

- Before upload begins, the upload progress is indeterminate (at this point,
  it’s just spinning),
- Once we know the size of the image and begin upload (using axios) then we
  update the progress value of the CircularProgress (at this point, it shows the
  progress). CircularProgress also comes with the aria-\* attributes to make its
  progress value accessible to screenreaders.

CircularProgress also comes with the aria-\* attributes to make its progress
value accessible to screenreaders.

### Spinner

It is more of a “presentational” loading indicator you can use on a page or a
component, while it’s loading or before it renders. It doesn’t have any semantic
meaning.

To give meaning to a Spinner/loading indicator, ARIA standards require that you
mark the area of the component/page that’s loading with `aria-busy=true`.

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/react-env@1.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/react-env

React component and hook for handling window and document object in iframe or
ssr environment

> This is an internal utility, not intended for public usage.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/react-env
# or
npm i @chakra-ui/react-env
```

## Usage

To get it working, you need to wrap your app in `EnvironmentProvider` and call
the `useEnvironment` hook anywhere in your app to get access to the correct
`window` and `document`.

```jsx
import { EnvironmentProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react-env"

// in your App
const App = ({ children }) => {
  return <EnvironmentProvider>{children}</EnvironmentProvider>
}

// read the environment
const WindowSize = () => {
  const { window } = useEnvironment()
  return (
    <pre>
      {JSON.stringify({
        w: window.innerWidth,
        h: window.innerHeight,
      })}
    </pre>
  )
}
```

If you wrap specific aspects of your app within an `iframe`, you'll need to wrap
the content in the iframe in `EnvironmentProvider` to provide the correct
`window` and `document` to its content.

```jsx
// in your app
const EmbeddedIFrame = () => {
  return (
    <Frame>
      <EnvironmentProvider>
        <WindowSize />
      </EnvironmentProvider>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

# Welcome to Chakra UI ⚡️

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

- Works out of the box. Chakra UI contains a set of polished React components
  that work out of the box.

- Flexible & composable. Chakra UI components are built on top of a React UI
  Primitive for endless composability.

- Accessible. Chakra UI components follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines
  specifications.

- Dark Mode 😍: All components are dark mode compatible.

## Looking for the documentation?

https://chakra-ui.com

## Installing Chakra UI

⚡️Chakra UI is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import
one by one. All you need to do is install the `@chakra-ui/react` package:

```sh
$ yarn add @chakra-ui/react
# or
$ npm install --save @chakra-ui/react
```

# Getting set up

To start using the components, please follow these steps:

1. Wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` provided by **@chakra-ui/react**

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, ColorModeProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const App = ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <ColorModeProvider>{children}</ColorModeProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

`ColorModeProvider` is a context that provides light mode and dark mode values
to the components. It also comes with a function to toggle between light/dark
mode.

2. Now you can start using components like so!:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const App = () => <Button>I just consumed some ⚡️Chakra!</Button>
```

# Contributing

Feel like contributing? That's awesome! We have a
[contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to help guide you.

The components to be built come from the
[Aria Practices Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1).

        d="M20 12l-1.41-1.41L13 16.17V4h-2v12.17l-5.58-5.59L4 12l8 8 8-8z"
      />
    </Icon>
  )
  return <Select icon={SelectIcon} placeholder="Placeholder" size="md" />
}
```

## Focus border color and error border color

Pass the `focusBorderColor` prop to change the border color of the select
component in the focused state.

Pass the `errorBorderColor` prop to change the border color of the select
component in the invalid state.

The value of these props can be set to a color in the theme object, or a raw CSS
value.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Select focusBorderColor="lime" placeholder="Here is a sample placeholder" />

  <Select
    isInvalid
    errorBorderColor="crimson"
    placeholder="Here is a sample placeholder"

```

## Overriding the Select styles

Even though the select comes with predefined styles, you can override pretty
much any property. Here's we'll override the background color.

```jsx
<Select
  color="white"
  borderColor="tomato"
  backgroundColor="tomato"
  placeholder="Woohoo! A new background color!"
/>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/system@1.8.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/system

Styled API for creating atomic, theme-aware component styling.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/system

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/system
```

## Problem

In modern web development, we have lots of solutions and architectures that have
tried to unify how components are styled. We've seen CSS architectures like BEM,
SMACSS, etc, and frameworks like theme-ui, and Tailwind CSS.

While these solutions work great, we still think there is a sheer amount of work
required to create a fully customizable, theme-aware component.

## Solutions

### Chakra Elements

Chakra provides enhanced JSX elements that can be styled directly via props, or
can accept the common `sx` prop for custom styles.

We'll provide a chakra function, just like styled-components. Users can create
any component using the `chakra.[element]`. The resulting component will be a
styled component and have all system props.

```jsx
<chakra.button bg="green.200" _hover={{ bg: "green.300" }}>
  Click me
</chakra.button>

<chakra.h1 fontSize="lg"> Heading </chakra.h1>

// create your own box
const Box = chakra.div

// you can still use the `as` prop
<Box as="h1">This is my box</Box>

// for custom components
const ChakraPowered = chakra(YourComponent)

// TS: chakra will infer the types of Link and
// make it available in props
<chakra.a as={Link} to="/home"> Click me</chakra.a>
```

### Chakra Component API

A way to define themable components in chakra. We believe most re-usable, atomic
components have the following modifiers:

- Size: It has different size variations (small, medium, large)
- Variant: It has different visual style (outline, solid, ghost)
- Color scheme (Optional): For a given variant, it can have several color
  scheme. For example, an outline button with a red color scheme.
- Color mode (Optional): Components also change their visual styles based on the
  user preferred color mode (light or dark)

Our goal with this component API is to design a common interface to style any
component given these characteristics. Here's how it works:

```jsx
// 1. create a component schema in your theme
const theme = {
  colors: {
    green: {
      light: "#dfdfdf",
      normal: "#dfdfdf",
      dark: "#d566Df",
      darker: "#dfd56f"
    },
    blue: {}
  },
  components: {
    Button: {
      defaultProps: {
        variant: "solid",
        size: "md",
	colorScheme: "blue"
      },
      variants: {
	// props has colorScheme, colorMode (light mode or dark mode)
        solid: props => ({
          bg: `${props.colorScheme}.normal`,
          color: "white",
        }),
        outline: {
          border: "2px",
          borderColor: "green.normal"
        }
      },
      sizes: {
        sm: {
          padding: 20,
          fontSize: 12
        },
        md: {
          padding: 40,
          fontSize: 15
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

// 2. create or import Button from chakra-ui
import { Button } from "@chakra-ui/react"

// or your own button
const Button = chakra("button", { themeKey: "Button" })

// 3. use the button. It'll have the visual props defined in defaultProps
<Button>Click me</Button>

// 4. override the defaultProps
<Button variant="outline" colorScheme="green">Click me</Button>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/table@1.3.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/table

An accessible table component.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/table

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/table
```

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @chakra-ui/tabs@1.6.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @chakra-ui/tabs

An accessible tabs component.

The `Tab` and `TabPanel` elements are associated by their order in the tree.
None of the components are empty wrappers, each is associated with a real DOM
element in the document, giving you maximum control over styling and
composition.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @chakra-ui/tabs

# or

npm i @chakra-ui/tabs
```

## Import components

```jsx
import { Tabs, TabList, TabPanels, Tab, TabPanel } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>One</Tab>
    <Tab>Two</Tab>
    <Tab>Three</Tab>
  </TabList>

  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>one!</p>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>two!</p>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>three!</p>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Tab variants and color schemes

Tabs come in 6 different variants to style the tabs: `line`,`enclosed`,
`enclosed-colored`, `soft-rounded`, `solid-rounded`. Each variant comes it
different color schemes.

```jsx
<Tabs variant="enclosed" colorScheme="red">
  <TabList>
    <Tab>One</Tab>
    <Tab>Two</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>one!</p>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>two!</p>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Manually Activated Tabs

By default, `Tabs` are activated automatically. This means when you use the
arrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.

The content of a `TabPanel` should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching
to a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might
be some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and
screen reader users.

In this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, it moves focus
without activating the tabs. With focus on a specifc tab, users can activate a
tab by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```jsx
<Tabs isManual variant="enclosed">
  <TabList>
    <Tab>One</Tab>
    <Tab>Two</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>one!</p>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>two!</p>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Tab sizes

You can change the size of the tab by passing `size` prop. We support 3 sizes
`sm`, `md`, `lg`

```jsx
<Tabs size="md" variant="enclosed">
  <TabList>
    <Tab>One</Tab>
    <Tab>Two</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>one!</p>
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      <p>two!</p>
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Positioning toast

By default, all the toasts will be positioned on the `top-right` of your
browser.

The following values are allowed: **top-right, top, top-left, bottom-right,
bottom, bottom-left**

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import useToast from "@chakra-ui/toast"

const Position = () => {
  const toast = useToast()

  const notify = () => {
    toast({ title: "Success Notification !", status: "success" })
  }

  return <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>
}
```

### Set autoClose delay or disable it

To change the show delay for any toast, simply pass the `duration` prop when
invoking the `toast` function.

> Note 🚨: If you pass `null` as the duration, the toast will always remain on
> screen.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import useToast from "@chakra-ui/toast"

const Duration = () => {
  const toast = useToast()

  const notify = () => {
    toast({
      duration: 5000,
      title: "I will close after 5 secs",
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>
}
```

### Render a custom toast component

Display a custom component instead of the default Toast UI.

We provide 2 key `props` to your component, `id`, and `onClose` to close the
toast (to build your custom close button).

```jsx
function Example() {
  const toast = useToast()

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => {
        toast({
          position: "bottom-left",
          render: (props) => (
            <Box m={3} color="white" p={3} bg="blue.500">
              Hello World
            </Box>
          ),
        })
      }}
    >
      Show Toast
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Use a custom id

A custom `id` can be used to replace the one internal auto-generated toast `id`.
You can use a `number` or a `string`.

This is mostly useful when you need to prevent duplication of a specific toast.

### Prevent duplicate

To prevent duplicates, you can check if a given toast is active by calling
`toast.isActive(id)` like the snippet below. Or, you can use a custom `toastId`:

```js
import * as React from "react"
import useToast from "@chakra-ui/toast"

const Example = () => {
  const toast = useToast()

  const id = "login-toast"

  const notify = () => {
    if (!toast.isActive(id)) {
      toast({ title: "Dude! I cannot be duplicated" })
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Update a toast

When you update a toast, the toast options and the content are inherited but
don't worry you can update them.

```js
import * as React from "react"
import useToast from "@chakra-ui/toast"

const Update = () => {
  const toast = useToast()

  const id = React.useRef(null)

  const notify = () => {
    id.current = toast({
      title: "Chidori is not available!",
      duration: null,
    })
  }

  const update = () => {
    toast.update(id.current, {
      title: "Sharingan is all you have!",
      status: "success",
      duration: 5000,
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>
      <button onClick={update}>Update</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - apollo-upload-client@16.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

![Apollo upload logo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client@1.0.0/apollo-upload-logo.svg)

# apollo-upload-client

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/apollo-upload-client)](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/actions)

A [terminating Apollo Link](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/#the-terminating-link) for [Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/react) that fetches a [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) if the GraphQL variables contain files (by default [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList), [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), or [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances), or else fetches a regular [GraphQL POST or GET request](https://apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/requests) (depending on the config and GraphQL operation).

## Setup

To install with [npm](https://npmjs.com/get-npm), run:

```sh
npm install apollo-upload-client
```

Remove any `uri`, `credentials`, or `headers` options from the [`ApolloClient` constructor](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#the-apolloclient-constructor).

[Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/react) can only have 1 [terminating Apollo Link](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/#the-terminating-link) that sends the GraphQL requests; if one such as [`HttpLink`](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-http) is already setup, remove it.

Initialize the client with a [terminating Apollo Link](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/#the-terminating-link) using [`createUploadLink`](#function-createuploadlink).

Also ensure the GraphQL server implements the [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) and that uploads are handled correctly in resolvers.

## Usage

Use [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList), [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) or [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances anywhere within query or mutation variables to send a [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

See also the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList)

```jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation ($files: [Upload!]!) {
    uploadFiles(files: $files) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFiles() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({ target: { validity, files } }) {
    if (validity.valid) mutate({ variables: { files } });
  }

  return <input type="file" multiple required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

```jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation ($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFile() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({
    target: {
      validity,
      files: [file],
    },
  }) {
    if (validity.valid) mutate({ variables: { file } });
  }

  return <input type="file" required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

### [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)

```jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation ($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFile() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({ target: { validity, value } }) {
    if (validity.valid) {
      const file = new Blob([value], { type: 'text/plain' });

      // Optional, defaults to `blob`.
      file.name = 'text.txt';

      mutate({ variables: { file } });
    }
  }

  return <input type="text" required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

_A camera roll file._

> ```js
> const fileSubstitute = {
>   uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
>   name: 'a.jpg',
>   type: 'image/jpeg',
> };

This package contains the following license and notice below:

aria-hidden
====
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/aria-hidden.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/aria-hidden/)

Hides from ARIA everything, except provided node.
Helps to isolate modal dialogs and focused task - the content will be not accessible using
accesible tools.

# API
Just call `hideOthers` with DOM-node you want to keep, and it will hide everything else.
targetNode could be placed anywhere - its siblings would be hidden, but its parents - not.
```js
import {hideOthers} from 'aria-hidden';

const undo = hideOthers(DOMnode);
// everything else is "aria-hidden"

undo();
// all changes undone
```

you also may limit the effect by providing top level node as a second paramiter
```js
 hideOthers(targetNode, parentNode);
 hideOthers(anotherNode, document.getElementById('app'));
 // parentNode defaults to document.body 
```

# Inspiration
Based on [smooth-ui](https://github.com/smooth-code/smooth-ui) modal dialogs.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

data-uri-to-buffer
==================
### Generate a Buffer instance from a [Data URI][rfc] string
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer)

This module accepts a ["data" URI][rfc] String of data, and returns a
node.js `Buffer` instance with the decoded data.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install data-uri-to-buffer
```


Example
-------

``` js
var dataUriToBuffer = require('data-uri-to-buffer');

// plain-text data is supported
var uri = 'data:,Hello%2C%20World!';
var decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'

// base64-encoded data is supported
uri = 'data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D';
decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri);
console.log(decoded.toString());
// 'Hello, World!'
```


API
---

### dataUriToBuffer(String uri) → Buffer

The `type` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the main type portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"text/plain"` if not
specified.

The `typeFull` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the entire
"mediatype" portion of the "data" URI (including all parameters), or defaults
to `"text/plain;charset=US-ASCII"` if not specified.

The `charset` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Charset portion of
the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"US-ASCII"` if the
entire type is not specified, or defaults to `""` otherwise.

*Note*: If the only the main type is specified but not the charset, e.g.
`"data:text/plain,abc"`, the charset is set to the empty string. The spec only
defaults to US-ASCII as charset if the entire type is not specified.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## Benchmarks

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - extract-files@11.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# extract-files

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/extract-files)](https://npm.im/extract-files) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/actions)

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) instance arrays.

Used by [GraphQL multipart request spec client implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#implementations) such as [`graphql-react`](https://npm.im/graphql-react) and [`apollo-upload-client`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client).

## Setup

To install with [npm](https://npmjs.com/get-npm), run:

```sh
npm install extract-files
```

See the documentation for the function [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles) to get started.

## Support

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): `^12.20 || >= 14.13`
- [Browsers](https://npm.im/browserslist): `> 0.5%, not OperaMini all, not IE > 0, not dead`
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)

## API

- [class ReactNativeFile](#class-reactnativefile)
- [function extractFiles](#function-extractfiles)
- [function isExtractableFile](#function-isextractablefile)
- [type ExtractableFile](#type-extractablefile)
- [type ExtractableFileMatcher](#type-extractablefilematcher)
- [type ExtractFilesResult](#type-extractfilesresult)
- [type ObjectPath](#type-objectpath)
- [type ReactNativeFileSubstitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute)

### class ReactNativeFile

Used to mark a [React Native `File` substitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) in an object tree for [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles). It’s too risky to assume all objects with `uri`, `type` and `name` properties are files to extract.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `file` | [ReactNativeFileSubstitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) | A [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) substitute. |

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { ReactNativeFile } from 'extract-files';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import ReactNativeFile from 'extract-files/public/ReactNativeFile.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { ReactNativeFile } = require('extract-files');
> ```
>
> ```js
> const ReactNativeFile = require('extract-files/public/ReactNativeFile.js');
> ```

_An extractable file in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)._

> ```js
> const file = new ReactNativeFile({
>   uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
>   name: 'a.jpg',
>   type: 'image/jpeg',
> });
> ```

---

### function extractFiles

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) instance arrays.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `value` | \* | Value (typically an object tree) to extract files from. |
| `path` | [ObjectPath](#type-objectpath)? = `''` | Prefix for object paths for extracted files. |
| `isExtractableFile` | [ExtractableFileMatcher](#type-extractablefilematcher)? = [isExtractableFile](#function-isextractablefile) | The function used to identify extractable files. |

**Returns:** [ExtractFilesResult](#type-extractfilesresult) — Result.

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import extractFiles from 'extract-files/public/extractFiles.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { extractFiles } = require('extract-files');
> ```
>
> ```js
> const extractFiles = require('extract-files/public/extractFiles.js');
> ```

_Extract files from an object._

> For the following:
>
> ```js
> const file1 = new File(['1'], '1.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const file2 = new File(['2'], '2.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const value = {
>   a: file1,
>   b: [file1, file2],
> };
>
> const { clone, files } = extractFiles(value, 'prefix');
> ```
>
> `value` remains the same.
>
> `clone` is:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "a": null,
>   "b": [null, null]
> }
> ```
>
> `files` is a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) instance containing:
>
> | Key     | Value                        |
> | :------ | :--------------------------- |
> | `file1` | `['prefix.a', 'prefix.b.0']` |
> | `file2` | `['prefix.b.1']`             |

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Glob To Regular Expression

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp)

Turn a \*-wildcard style glob (`"*.min.js"`) into a regular expression
(`/^.*\.min\.js$/`)!

To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for
character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with
`{ extended: true }`.

To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`.
NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below:
When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/`
like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match
any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`,
`/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.
Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with
`/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that
contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.

Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: "i" }` for ignoring case.

## Install

    npm install glob-to-regexp

## Usage
```js
var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp');
var re = globToRegExp("p*uck");
re.test("pot luck"); // true
re.test("pluck"); // true
re.test("puck"); // true

re = globToRegExp("*.min.js");
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map"); // false

re = globToRegExp("*/www/*.js");
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js"); // true

// Extended globs
re = globToRegExp("*/www/{*.js,*.html}", { extended: true });
re.test("http://example.com/www/app.js"); // true
re.test("http://example.com/www/index.html"); // true
```

This package contains the following license and notice below:

![graphql-upload logo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaydenseric/graphql-upload@8.0.0/graphql-upload-logo.svg)

# graphql-upload

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphql-upload)](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/actions)

Middleware and an [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar to add support for [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) (file uploads via queries and mutations) to various Node.js GraphQL servers.

## Setup

First, check if there are [GraphQL multipart request spec server implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#server) (most for Node.js integrate [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload)) that are more suitable for your environment than a manual setup.

To install [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) and the [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) peer dependency with [npm](https://npmjs.com/get-npm), run:

```sh
npm install graphql-upload graphql
```

Use the [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) or [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) middleware just before GraphQL middleware. Alternatively, use [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) to create custom middleware.

A schema built with separate SDL and resolvers (e.g. using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/api/modules/schema#makeexecutableschema) from [`@graphql-tools/schema`](https://npm.im/@graphql-tools/schema)) requires the [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar to be setup.

## Usage

[Clients implementing the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#client) upload files as [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar query or mutation variables. Their resolver values are promises that resolve [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage. Files are typically streamed into cloud storage but may also be stored in the filesystem.

See the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### Tips

- The process must have both read and write access to the directory identified by [`os.tmpdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).
- The device requires sufficient disk space to buffer the expected number of concurrent upload requests.
- Promisify and await file upload streams in resolvers or the server will send a response to the client before uploads are complete, causing a disconnect.
- Handle file upload promise rejection and stream errors; uploads sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or impatient users disconnecting.
- Process multiple uploads asynchronously with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise/all) or a more flexible solution such as [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) where an error in one does not reject them all.
- Only use [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload) _before_ the resolver returns; late calls (e.g. in an unawaited async function or callback) throw an error. Existing streams can still be used after a response is sent, although there are few valid reasons for not awaiting their completion.
- Use [`stream.destroy()`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_destroy_error) when an incomplete stream is no longer needed, or temporary files may not get cleaned up.

## Architecture

The [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) allows a file to be used for multiple query or mutation variables (file deduplication), and for variables to be used in multiple places. GraphQL resolvers need to be able to manage independent file streams. As resolvers are executed asynchronously, it’s possible they will try to process files in a different order than received in the multipart request.

[`busboy`](https://npm.im/busboy) parses multipart request streams. Once the `operations` and `map` fields have been parsed, [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar values in the GraphQL operations are populated with promises, and the operations are passed down the middleware chain to GraphQL resolvers.

[`fs-capacitor`](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) is used to buffer file uploads to the filesystem and coordinate simultaneous reading and writing. As soon as a file upload’s contents begins streaming, its data begins buffering to the filesystem and its associated promise resolves. GraphQL resolvers can then create new streams from the buffer by calling [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload). The buffer is destroyed once all streams have ended or closed and the server has responded to the request. Any remaining buffer files will be cleaned when the process exits.

## Support

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): `^12.20 || >= 14.13`

### class Upload

A file expected to be uploaded as it has been declared in the `map` field of a [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). The [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) function places references to an instance of this class wherever the file is expected in the [GraphQL operation](#type-graphqloperation). The [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar derives it’s value from the [`promise`](#upload-instance-property-promise) property.

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { Upload } from 'graphql-upload';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import Upload from 'graphql-upload/public/Upload.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { Upload } = require('graphql-upload');
> ```
>
> ```js
> const Upload = require('graphql-upload/public/Upload.js');
> ```

#### Upload instance method reject

Rejects the upload promise with an error. This should only be utilized by [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest).

| Parameter | Type   | Description     |
| :-------- | :----- | :-------------- |
| `error`   | object | Error instance. |

#### Upload instance method resolve

Resolves the upload promise with the file upload details. This should only be utilized by [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest).

| Parameter | Type                           | Description          |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| `file`    | [FileUpload](#type-fileupload) | File upload details. |

#### Upload instance property file

The file upload details, available when the [upload promise](#upload-instance-property-promise) resolves. This should only be utilized by [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest).

**Type:** `undefined` | [FileUpload](#type-fileupload)

#### Upload instance property promise

Promise that resolves file upload details. This should only be utilized by [`GraphQLUpload`](#class-graphqlupload).

### function processRequest

Processes a [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). It parses the `operations` and `map` fields to create an [`Upload`](#class-upload) instance for each expected file upload, placing references wherever the file is expected in the [GraphQL operation](#type-graphqloperation) for the [`Upload`](#class-graphqlupload) scalar to derive it’s value. Errors are created with [`http-errors`](https://npm.im/http-errors) to assist in sending responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. Used in [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) and [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) and can be used to create custom middleware.

**Type:** [ProcessRequestFunction](#type-processrequestfunction)

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { processRequest } from 'graphql-upload';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import processRequest from 'graphql-upload/public/processRequest.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { processRequest } = require('graphql-upload');
> ```
>
> ```js

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:
**********************************

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
public;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# load-script

Dynamic script loading.

## Installation

via component

```
$ component install eldargab/load-script
```

via npm

```
$ npm install load-script
```

## API
`load-script` appends a `script` node to the `<head>` element in the dom.

`require('load-script')` returns a function of the following interface:  `function(url[, opts][, cb]) {}`

### url
Any url that you would like to load.  May be absolute or relative.

### [, opts]
A map of options.  Here are the currently supported options:

* `async` - A boolean value used for `script.async`.  By default this is `true`.
* `attrs` - A map of attributes to set on the `script` node before appending it to the DOM.  By default this is empty.
* `charset` - A string value used for `script.charset`.  By default this is `utf8`.
* `text` - A string of text to append to the `script` node before it is appended to the DOM.  By default this is empty.
* `type` - A string used for `script.type`.  By default this is `text/javascript`.

### [, cb]
A callback function of the following interface: `function(err, script) {}` where `err` is an error if any occurred and `script` is the `script` node that was appended to the DOM.

## Example Usage

```javascript
var load = require('load-script')

load('foo.js', function (err, script) {
  if (err) {
    // print useful message
  }
  else {
    console.log(script.src);// Prints 'foo'.js'
    // use script
    // note that in IE8 and below loading error wouldn't be reported
  }
})
```

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png" height="40" align="right" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Webpack

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)

*This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

Simply add the plugin to both the `resolver` and `resolveLoader`:

```js
const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin,
    ],
  },
  resolveLoader: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),
    ],
  },
};
```

The `resolve` entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the `resolveLoader` entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.

In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
    }]
  },
};
```

<hr />

> v1+ for React 15, v2+ requires React 16.8+

Removes scroll bar (by setting `overflow: hidden` on body), and preserves the scroll bar "gap".

Read - it just makes scroll bar invisible.

Does nothing if scroll bar does not consume any space.

# Usage

```js
import {RemoveScrollBar} from 'react-remove-scroll-bar';

<RemoveScrollBar /> -> no scroll bar
```

### The Right Border
To prevent content jumps __position:fixed__ elements with `right:0`  should have additional classname applied.
It will just provide a _non-zero_ right, when it needed, to maintain the right "gap".
```js
import {zeroRightClassName,fullWidthClassName, noScrollbarsClassName} from 'react-remove-scroll-bar';

// to set `right:0` on an element
<div className={zeroRightClassName} />

// to set `width:100%` on an element
<div className={fullWidthClassName} />

// to remove scrollbar from an element
<div className={noScrollbarsClassName} />

```

# Size
500b after compression (excluding tslib).

# Scroll-Locky
All code is a result of a [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) refactoring.

# Article
There is a medium article about preventing the body scroll - [How to fight the <body> scroll](https://medium.com/@antonkorzunov/how-to-fight-the-body-scroll-2b00267b37ac)

react-remove-scroll
====
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-remove-scroll.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-remove-scroll)

Disables scroll outside of `children` node.

- 🖱 mouse and touch devices friendly
- 📈 vertical and horizontal
- 📜 removes document scroll bar maintaining it space
- ✅ support nested scrollable elements
- 🕳 supports react-portals (uses React Event system)
- ☠️ it could block literally any scroll anywhere

# Usage
Just wrap content, which should be scrollable, and everything else would not. 
```js
import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';

<RemoveScroll>
  Only this content would be scrollable
</RemoveScroll>  
```

`RemoveScroll` accept following props
- `children`
- `[enabled]` - activate or deactivate component behaviour without removing it.
- `[allowPinchZoom=false]` - enabled "pinch-n-zoom" behavior. By default it might be prevented. However - pinch and zoom might break "scroll isolation", and __disabled by default__.
- `[noIsolation=false]` - disables outer event capturing. Event capturing is React friendly and unlikely be a problem.
But if you are using _shadowbox_ of some sort - you dont need it.
- `[inert=false]` - ☠️(be careful) disables events the rest of page completely using `pointer-events` except the Lock(+shards). 
React portals not friendly, might lead to production issues. Enable only for __rare__ cases, when you have to disable scrollbars somewhere on the page(except body, Lock and shards).  
- `[forwardProps]` - will forward all props to the `children`
- `[className]` - className for an internal div
- `[removeScrollBar]` - to control scroll bar removal. Set to false, if you prefer to keep it (wheel and touch scroll is still disabled).

# Size
- (🧩 full) 1.7kb after compression (excluding tslib).
---
- (👁 UI) __400b__, visual elements only
- (🚗 sidecar) 1.5kb, side effects
```js
import {sidecar} from "react-remove-scroll";
import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll/UI';

const sidecar = sidecar(() => import('react-remove-scroll/sidecar'));

<RemoveScroll sideCar={sidecar}>
  Will load logic from a sidecar when needed
</RemoveScroll>  
```

> Consider setting `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on a document level for a proper mobile experience.

## Internal div
But default RemoveScroll will create a div to handle and capture events.
You may specify `className` for it, if you need, or __remove it__.

The following code samples will produce the same output
```js
<RemoveScroll className="scroll">
  Only this content would be scrollable
</RemoveScroll>
```

```js
<RemoveScroll forwardProps>
  <div className="scroll"> //RemoveScroll will inject props to this div
    Only this content would be scrollable
  </div>
</RemoveScroll> 
```
Pick the first one if you don't need a second.

## Position:fixed elements
To properly size these elements please add a special className to them.
```jsx
import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';

// to make "width: 100%"
<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.fullWidth)} />

// to make "right:0"
<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.zeroRight)} />
```
See [react-remove-scroll-bar](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll-bar) documentation for details.

## More than one lock
When stacked more is active (default) only one (last) component would be active.

## Over isolation
That could happen - 
you disable scroll on the body, 
you are suppressing all scroll and wheel events,
and you are ghosting the rest of the page by the `inert` prop.

Only something inside Lock does exists for the browser, and that might be less than you expected.

Dont forget about `shard`, dont forget - `inert` is not portals friendly, dont forget - you dont need over isolation in most of the cases.

> just be careful! 

# Performance
To do the job this library setup _non_ passive event listener. Chrome dev tools would complain about it, as a 
performance no-op.

We have to use synchronous scroll/touch handler, and it may affect scrolling performance.

Consider using `noIsolation` mode, if you have large scrollable areas.

# Supported React versions
- v1 supports React 15/16
- v2 requires 16.8.0+ (hooks)

# Scroll-Locky
This is a refactoring of another library - [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) -
to make package smaller and more react-portals friendly.

## See also

 > This package is relative smaller(1), more react friendly(2), works with non zero body margins(3), and has a better "overscroll" management.

# JavaScript Driver

This package is the officially supported driver for querying a
RethinkDB database from a JavaScript application.  It is designed to
be run in Node.js but also has an alternate http connection type that
is used by the RethinkDB web ui.  The http connection type is not
intended to be used by applications, since it isn't secure.
Ultimately, the http connection type will move into the web ui code
and out of the driver.

Check out
[rethinkdb.com/api/javascript](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript)
for documentation and examples of using this driver.

## Creating the proto-def.js

To build the JavaScript driver, you'll need to first generate the
definitions file `proto-def.js`. To do that from the `drivers`
directory, you can do:

```bash
$ ./convert_protofile -l javascript \
   -i ../src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto \
   -o ./javascript/proto-def.js

string-hash
===========

A fast string hashing function for Node.JS. The particular algorithm is quite
similar to `djb2`, by Dan Bernstein and available
[here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Differences include iterating
over the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR
operator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and
because it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).

The hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).

Thanks to [cscott](https://github.com/cscott) for reminding us how integers
work in JavaScript.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# <img src="http://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/images/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png" height="40" align="right" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for TypeScript

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)

*This plugin is also available for Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin)), Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), and Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D ts-pnp
```

## Usage

*Note that `ts-pnp` is a low-level package - you shouldn't have to use it unless you're writing a TS compiler host. If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*

This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.

```js
import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';
import * as ts from 'typescript';

function createCompilerHost(
  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,
): ts.CompilerHost {
  const compilerHost = {
    resolveModuleNames,
    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,
  };

  return compilerHost;

  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {
      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;
    });
  }

  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {
      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;
    });
  }
}
```

> Keep in mind that useRef doesn't notify you when its content changes.
Mutating the .current property doesn't cause a re-render.
If you want to run some code when React attaches or detaches a ref to a DOM node, 
you may want to use ~~a callback ref instead~~ .... __useCallbackRef__ instead.

– [Hooks API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

Read more about `use-callback` pattern and use cases: 
- https://dev.to/thekashey/the-same-useref-but-it-will-callback-8bo


This library exposes helpers to handle any case related to `ref` _lifecycle_

- `useCallbackRef` - react on hook change
- `mergeRefs` - merge multiple refs together. For, actually, fork
- `transformRef` - transform one ref to anther
- `refToCallback` - convert RefObject to an old callback-style ref
- `assignRef` - assign value to the ref, regardless of it's form

All functions are tree shakable, but even together it's __less then 300b__.

# API
💡 Some commands are hooks based, and returns the same refs/functions every render. 
But some are not, to be used in classes or non-react code.

## useRef API
🤔 Use case: every time you have to react to ref change

API is 99% compatible with React `createRef` and `useRef`, and just adds another argument - `callback`,
which would be called on __ref update__.

#### createCallbackRef - to replace React.createRef
- `createCallbackRef(callback)` -  would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.

#### useCallbackRef - to replace React.useRef
- `useCallbackRef(initialValue, callback)` - would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.

> `callback` in both cases is `callback(newValue, oldValue)`. Callback would not be called if newValue and oldValue is the same.

```js
import {useRef, createRef, useState} from 'react';
import {useCallbackRef, createCallbackRef} from 'use-callback-ref';

const Component = () => {
  const [,forceUpdate] = useState();
  // I dont need callback when ref changes
  const ref = useRef(null); 
  
  // but sometimes - it could be what you need
  const anotherRef = useCallbackRef(null, () => forceUpdate());
  
  useEffect( () => {
    // now it's just possible
  }, [anotherRef.current]) // react to dom node change
}
```

💡 You can use `useCallbackRef` to convert RefObject into RefCallback, creating bridges between the old and the new code
```js
// some old component
const onRefUpdate = (newValue) => {...}
const refObject = useCallbackRef(null, onRefUpdate);
// ...
<SomeNewComponent ref={refObject}/>
```

## assignRef
🤔 Use case: every time you need to assign ref manually, and you dont know the shape of the ref

`assignRef(ref, value)` - assigns `values` to the `ref`. `ref` could be RefObject or RefCallback.

```
🚫 ref.current = value // what if it's a callback-ref?
🚫 ref(value) // but what if it's a object ref?

import {assignRef} from "use-callback-ref";
✅ assignRef(ref, value); 
```

## useTransformRef (to replace React.useImperativeHandle)
🤔 Use case: ref could be different. 
`transformRef(ref, tranformer):Ref` - return a new `ref` which would propagate all changes to the provided `ref` with applied `transform`

```js
// before
const ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>
  <Resizable {...props} ref={i => i && ref(i.resizable)}/>
);

// after

const ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>
  <Resizable {...props} ref={transformRef(ref, i => i ? i.resizable : null)}/>
);
```

## refToCallback
`refToCallback(ref: RefObject): RefCallback` - for compatibility between the old and the new code.
For the compatibility between `RefCallback` and RefObject use `useCallbackRef(undefined, callback)` 

## useMergeRefs
`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together

When developing low level UI components, it is common to have to use a local ref but also support an external one using React.forwardRef. Natively, React does not offer a way to set two refs inside the ref property. This is the goal of this small utility.

```js
import React from 'react'
import {useMergeRefs} from 'use-callback-ref'

const MergedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const localRef = React.useRef();
  // ...
  // both localRef and ref would be populated with the `ref` to a `div`
  return <div ref={useMergeRefs([localRef, ref])} />
})
```

💡 - `useMergeRefs` will always give you the same return, and you don't have to worry about `[localRef, ref]` unique every render.

## mergeRefs 
`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together
is a non-hook based version. Will produce the new `ref` every run, causing the old one to unmount, and be _populated_ with the `null` value.

> mergeRefs are based on https://github.com/smooth-code/react-merge-refs, just exposes a RefObject, instead of a callback

`mergeRefs` are "safe" to use as a part of other hooks-based commands, but don't forget - it returns a new object every call. 

# Similar packages:
- [apply-ref](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton/apply-ref) - `applyRefs` is simular to `mergeRef`, `applyRef` is similar to `assignRef`
- [useForkRef](https://react-hooks.org/docs/use-fork-ref) - `useForkRef` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but accepts only two arguments.
- [react-merge-refs](https://github.com/gregberge/react-merge-refs) - `merge-refs` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but not a hook and does not provide "stable" reference.

---

> Is it a rocket science? No, `RefObject` is no more than `{current: ref}`, and `use-callback-ref` is no more than `getter` and `setter` on that field.

UI/Effects code splitting pattern
 - [read the original article](https://dev.to/thekashey/sidecar-for-a-code-splitting-1o8g) to understand concepts behind.
 - [read how Google](https://medium.com/@cramforce/designing-very-large-javascript-applications-6e013a3291a3) split view and logic.
 - [watch how Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) defers "interactivity" effects. 

## Terminology: 
- `sidecar` - non UI component, which may carry effects for a paired UI component.
- `UI` - UI component, which interactivity is moved to a `sidecar`.

`UI` is a _view_, `sidecar` is the _logic_ for it. Like Batman(UI) and his sidekick Robin(effects). 

## Concept
- a `package` exposes __3 entry points__ using a [nested `package.json` format](https://github.com/theKashey/multiple-entry-points-example):
  - default aka `combination`, and lets hope tree shaking will save you
  - `UI`, with only UI part
  - `sidecar`, with all the logic
  - > `UI` + `sidecar` === `combination`. The size of `UI+sidecar` might a bit bigger than size of their `combination`.
  Use [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to control their size independently. 
  

- package uses a `medium` to talk with own sidecar, breaking explicit dependency.
 
- if package depends on another _sidecar_ package:
  - it shall export dependency side car among own sidecar.
  - package imports own sidecar via `medium`, thus able to export multiple sidecars via one export. 

- final consumer uses `sidecar` or `useSidecar` to combine pieces together.  

## Rules
- `UI` components might use/import any other `UI` components
- `sidecar` could use/import any other `sidecar`

That would form two different code branches, you may load separately - UI first, and effect sidecar later.
That also leads to a obvious consequence - __one sidecar may export all sidecars__.
- to decouple `sidecars` from module exports, and be able to pick "the right" one at any point
you have to use `exportSidecar(medium, component)` to export it, and use the same `medium` to import it back.
- this limitation is for __libraries only__, as long as in the usercode you might 
dynamically import whatever and whenever you want. 

- `useMedium` is always async - action would be executed in a next tick, or on the logic load.
- `sidecar` is always async - is does not matter have you loaded logic or not - component would be 
rendered at least in the next tick.

> except `medium.read`, which synchronously read the data from a medium, 
and `medium.assingSyncMedium` which changes `useMedium` to be sync. 

## SSR and usage tracking
Sidecar pattern is clear:
- you dont need to use/render any `sidecars` on server.
- you dont have to load `sidecars` prior main render.

Thus - no usage tracking, and literally no SSR. It's just skipped.


# API

## createMedium()
- Type: Util. Creates shared effect medium for algebraic effect.
- Goal: To decouple modules from each other.
- Usage: `use` in UI side, and `assign` from side-car. All effects would be executed.
- Analog: WeakMap, React.__SECRET_DOM_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED
```js
const medium = createMedium(defaultValue);
const cancelCb = medium.useMedium(someData);

// like
useEffect(() => medium.useMedium(someData), []);

medium.assignMedium(someDataProcessor)

// createSidecarMedium is a helper for createMedium to create a "sidecar" symbol
const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();
```

> ! For consistence `useMedium` is async - sidecar load status should not affect function behavior,
thus effect would be always executed at least in the "next tick". You may alter
this behavior by using `medium.assingSyncMedium`.


## exportSidecar(medium, component)
- Type: HOC
- Goal: store `component` inside `medium` and return external wrapper
- Solving: decoupling module exports to support exporting multiple sidecars via a single entry point.
- Usage: use to export a `sidecar`
- Analog: WeakMap
```js
import {effectCar} from './medium';
import {EffectComponent} from './Effect';
// !!! - to prevent Effect from being imported
// `effectCar` medium __have__ to be defined in another file
// const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();
export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);
```

## sidecar(importer)
- Type: HOC
- Goal: React.lazy analog for code splitting, but does not require `Suspense`, might provide error failback.
- Usage: like React.lazy to load a side-car component.
- Analog: React.Lazy
```js
import {sidecar} from "use-sidecar";
const Sidecar =  sidecar(() => import('./sidecar'), <span>on fail</span>);

<>
 <Sidecar />
 <UI />
</> 
```
### Importing `exportedSidecar`
Would require additional prop to be set - ```<Sidecar sideCar={effectCar} />```

## useSidecar(importer)
- Type: hook, loads a `sideCar` using provided `importer` which shall follow React.lazy API
- Goal: to load a side car without displaying any "spinners".
- Usage: load side car for a component
- Analog: none
```js
import {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';

const [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'));
return (
  <>
    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}
    <UIComponent {...props}>
  </>
); 
```
### Importing `exportedSideCar`
You have to specify __effect medium__ to read data from, as long as __export itself is empty__.
```js
import {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';

/* medium.js: */ export const effectCar = useMedium({});
/* sideCar.js: */export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);

const [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'), effectCar); 
return (
  <>
    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}
    <UIComponent {...props}>
  </>
);
```

## renderCar(Component)
- Type: HOC, moves renderProp component to a side channel
- Goal: Provide render prop support, ie defer component loading keeping tree untouched.
- Usage: Provide `defaults` and use them until sidecar is loaded letting you code split (non visual) render-prop component
- Analog: - Analog: code split library like [react-imported-library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-library) or [@loadable/lib](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/library-splitting/).
```js
import {renderCar, sidecar} from "use-sidecar";
const RenderCar = renderCar(
  // will move side car to a side channel
  sidecar(() => import('react-powerplug').then(imports => imports.Value)),
  // default render props
  [{value: 0}]  
);

<RenderCar>
  {({value}) => <span>{value}</span>}
</RenderCar>
```

## setConfig(config)
```js
setConfig({
  onError, // sets default error handler
});
```

# Examples
## Deferred effect
Let's imagine - on element focus you have to do "something", for example focus anther element

#### Original code
```js
onFocus = event => {
  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {
    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)
  }
}
```

#### Sidecar code

3. Use medium (yes, .3)
```js
// we are calling medium with an original event as an argument
const onFocus = event => focusMedium.useMedium(event);
```
2. Define reaction
```js
// in a sidecar

// we are setting handler for the effect medium
// effect is complicated - we are skipping event "bubbling", 
// and focusing some button inside a parent
focusMedium.assignMedium(event => {
  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {
    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)
  }
});

```
1. Create medium
Having these constrains - we have to clone `event`, as long as React would eventually reuse SyntheticEvent, thus not
preserve `target` and `currentTarget`. 
```js
// 
const focusMedium = createMedium(null, event => ({...event}));
```
Now medium side effect is ok to be async

__Example__: [Effect for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/Lock.js#L48) - 1kb UI, 4kb sidecar

### Medium callback
Like a library level code splitting

#### Original code
```js
import {x, y} from './utils';

useEffect(() => {
  if (x()) {
    y()
  }
}, []);
```

#### Sidecar code

```js
// medium
const utilMedium = createMedium();

// utils
const x = () => { /* ... */};
const y = () => { /* ... */};

// medium will callback with exports exposed
utilMedium.assignMedium(cb => cb({
 x, y
}));


// UI
// not importing x and y from the module system, but would be given via callback
useEffect(() => {
  utilMedium.useMedium(({x,y}) => {
      if (x()) {
        y()
      }
  })
}, []);
```

- Hint: there is a easy way to type it
```js
const utilMedium = createMedium<(cb: typeof import('./utils')) => void>();
``` 

__Example__: [Callback API for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/MoveFocusInside.js#L12) 

### Split effects
Lets take an example from a Google - Calendar app, with view and logic separated.
To be honest - it's not easy to extract logic from application like calendar - usually it's tight coupled.

#### Original code
```js
const CalendarUI = () => { 
  const [date, setDate] = useState();
  const onButtonClick = useCallback(() => setDate(Date.now), []);
  
  return (
    <>
     <input type="date" onChange={setDate} value={date} />
     <input type="button" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
#### Sidecar code

```js
const CalendarUI = () => {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState({});
  const [date, setDate] = useState();
  
  return (
    <>
     <Sidecar setDate={setDate} setEvents={setEvents}/>
     <UILayout {...events} date={date}/>
    </>
  )
}

const UILayout = ({onDateChange, onButtonClick, date}) => (
  <>
      <input type="date" onChange={onDateChange} value={date} />
      <input type="button" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>
  </>
);

// in a sidecar
// we are providing callbacks back to UI
const Sidecar = ({setDate, setEvents}) => {
  useEffect(() => setEvents({
      onDateChange:setDate,
      onButtonClick: () => setDate(Date.now),
  }), []);
  
  return null;
}
```  

While in this example this looks a bit, you know, strange - there are 3 times more code
that in the original example - that would make a sense for a real Calendar, especially
if some helper library, like `moment`, has been used.

__Example__: [Effect for react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll/blob/666472d5c77fb6c4e5beffdde87c53ae63ef42c5/src/SideEffect.tsx#L166) - 300b UI, 2kb sidecar

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
